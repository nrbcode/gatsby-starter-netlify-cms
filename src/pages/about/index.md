### Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is a set of processes, best practices, and technology solutions that help protect your critical systems and network from digital attacks. As data has proliferated and more people work and connect from anywhere, bad actors have responded by developing sophisticated methods for gaining access to your resources and stealing data, sabotaging your business, or extorting money. Every year the number of attacks increases, and adversaries develop new methods of evading detection. An effective cybersecurity program includes people, processes, and technology solutions that together reduce the risk of business disruption, financial loss, and reputational damage from an attack.

### Privacy
Privacy is a fundamental right, essential to autonomy and the protection of human dignity, serving as the foundation upon which many other human rights are built.

Privacy enables us to create barriers and manage boundaries to protect ourselves from unwarranted interference in our lives, which allows us to negotiate who we are and how we want to interact with the world around us. Privacy helps us establish boundaries to limit who has access to our bodies, places and things, as well as our communications and our information.

### Anonymity
Many people don't want the things they say online to be connected with their offline identities. They may be concerned about political or economic retribution, harassment, or even threats to their lives. Whistleblowers report news that companies and governments would prefer to suppress; human rights workers struggle against repressive governments; parents try to create a safe way for children to explore; victims of domestic violence attempt to rebuild their lives where abusers cannot follow.

Instead of using their true names to communicate, these people choose to speak using pseudonyms (assumed names) or anonymously (no name at all). For these individuals and the organizations that support them, secure anonymity is critical. It may literally save lives.

### Information security
Information security and cybersecurity are often confused. InfoSec is a crucial part of cybersecurity, but it refers exclusively to the processes designed for data security. Cybersecurity is a more general term that includes InfoSec.

### Operational security (Op-sec)
the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.
